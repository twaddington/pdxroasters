        <h2>About PDX Roasters</h2>
        <p>Within the modest boundaries of Portland, Oregon there exist more than 40 craft coffee roasters, each of whom help make the city a coffee lover&rsquo;s dream. PDX Roasters is a joint project between Portland coffee aficionados, home roasters, developers, and designers who are driven to create a comprehensive and interactive guide for finding local, fresh-roasted coffee. Our goal is to connect the craft of coffee roasting to the daily ritual of coffee lovers. pdxroasters.com is completely not for profit and is built upon open-source frameworks.</p>
